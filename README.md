## Overview
![](./model_framework.jpg)

In this work we present PAIE: a simple, effective and low resource-required approach for sentence-/document-level event argument extraction. We formulate our contribution as follow.

1. We formulate and investigate prompt tuning under extractive settings. 
2. We extract multiple roles using a joint prompt once a time. It not only considers the interaction among different roles but also reduce time complexity significantly.


## Preparation

### Environment
To run our code, please install all the dependency packages by using the following command:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Data
We conduct experiments on three common datasets: ACE05, RAMS and WIKIEVENTS.
- ACE05: This dataset is not freely available. Access from [LDC](https://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2006T06) and preprocessing following [EEQA (2020'EMNLP)](https://github.com/xinyadu/eeqa/tree/master/proc).
- RAMS / WIKIEVENTS: We write a script for you for data processing. Run the following commands in the root directory of the repo.

```bash
bash ./data/download_dataset.sh
```  

Please make sure your data folder structure as below.
```bash

  │   ├── train_convert.json

```

## Run the model

### Quick start
You could simply run PAIE with following commands: 
```bash
bash ./scripts/train_{ace|rams|wikievent}.sh
```
Folders will be created automatically to store: 

1. Subfolder `checkpoint`: model parameters with best dev set result
2. File `log.txt`: recording hyper-parameters, training process and evaluation result
3. File `best_dev_results.log`/`best_test_related_results.log`: showing prediction results of checkpoints on every sample in dev/test set.

You could see hyperparameter setting in `./scripts/train_[dataset].sh` and `config_parser.py`. We give most of hyperparameters a brief explanation in `config_parser.py`.

Above three scripts train models with BART-base. If you want to train models with BART-Large, please change `--model_name_or_path` from `facebook/bart-base` to `facebook/bart-large` **or** run following commands:
```bash
bash ./scripts/train_{ace|rams|wikievent}_large.sh
```

### Experiments with multiple runs

Table.3 of [our paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2202.12109.pdf) shows the fluctuation of results due to random seed and other hyperparameters (learning rate mainly). You could run experiments multiple times to get a more stable and reliable results.

```bash
for seed in 13 21 42 88 100
do
    for lr in 1e-5 2e-5 3e-5 5e-5
    do
        bash ./scripts/train_{ace|rams|wikievent}.sh $seed $lr
    done
done
```

Each run will take ~4h so we highly recommend you to execute above command in parallel way.

### Without-bipartite-loss
You could run PAIE without bipartite matching loss by delete the command argument `--bipartite` **or** run following commands:
```bash
bash ./scripts/train_{ace|rams|wikievent}_nobipartite.sh
```

### Joint-prompt-or-not
Unlike multiple prompt strategy in PAIE, you could also prompt argument using template containing only one role (single prompt). Try it by changing `--model_type` from `paie` to `base` and set proper hyperparameters: `--max_span_num`, `--max_dec_seq_length` and `--th_delta`. Alternatively you could run following commands directly with hyperparameters we tuned:
```bash
bash ./scripts/train_{ace|rams|wikievent}_singleprompt.sh
```

### Manual-prompt-or-others
Besides manual prompt, provide another two joint-prompt choices as described in Section 3.2 of  [our paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2202.12109.pdf). We concelude them in the following:
1. (Default setting) Manual Prompt: All roles are connected manually with natural language
2. Concatenation Prompt: To concatenate all role names belonging to one event type.
3. Soft Prompt: Following [previous work](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.06599) about continuous prompt, we connect different roles with learnable, role-specific pseudo tokens.

Run following commands if you want to try Concatenation Prompt:
```bash
bash ./scripts/train_{ace|rams|wikievent}_concatprompt.sh
```

Run following commands if you want to try Soft Prompt:
```bash
bash ./scripts/train_{ace|rams|wikievent}_softprompt.sh
```


### Few-shot-setting
PAIE also performs well under low-annotation scenario. You could try it by set hyperparameters `--keep_ratio` to a number between 0 to 1, which controls the resampling rate from the original training examples. Simply you could also run scripts below:
```bash
KEEP_RATIO=0.2 bash ./scripts/train_{ace|rams|wikievent}_fewshot.sh
```
Note you could adjust the `KEEP_RATIO` value by yourself.
